# JuniperLucia's Orchard Origins
## A progression-based Origins datapack that I have put together.

Hello~! This is a project of mine I have been wanting to make for some time. This is a datapack all about unlocking origins to add to your abilities as you play through the game. A problem I have had with the base Origins mod was that either you were stuck experiencing only a portion of the mod, or you experienced the entire mod too quickly. This will be a pack that fixes that, forcing the player to accomplish certain tasks in order to access all of the content. If that playstyle isn't for you, I will also include the origins free of any restrictions in a separate datapack that is downloaded alongside the main datapack.

That being said, any origins you specifically like or wish to modify and use for your own packs are yours to keep! While I wouldn't mind credit being given, I just ask that you do not claim that you created any origin that comes from this pack. Lastly, thank you for reading this all and thank you for checking my work out. Have a good day (or night)~!
